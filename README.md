### Project Goal:

The goal of this project is to explore and communicate insights from Yelp's businesses, users, reviews and check-ins dataset of Portland restaurants. Through the project, We will learn how to properly develop and structure a complex visualization project.

### Project Summary:

**What will you accomplish?**

In our project, we would like to be able to answer these questions:



1. How are the restaurants geographically distributed in Portland?
2. Is there a relationship between the number of check-in and the number of reviews?
3. What are the top ranking restaurants in Portland area?
4. What are the most used keywords for restaurants in Portland?
5. Is a specific category of restaurants (like Chinese, Mexican) located mostly in a certain area or scattered all across the city?

**Why is your project important?**

In this project we will develop visualizations to help us understand Portland’s restaurants performance and rating in the neighborhood and show competitive analysis of other businesses in the same category. Therefore, it provides a better user experience for selecting restaurants, especially to those who travel to Portland and want to know the general restaurants information  of this area. In addition, we can group user reviews to provide in-depth feedback to restaurants so that they can improve their businesses.

**How will you execute your project?**



1. Use customized python scripts to fetch data from Yelp Fusion API.
2. Import cleaned dataset into tableau.
3. Use longitude and latitude data to geoplot the restaurants’ locations in Portland.
4. Use tree map to filter different categories of restaurants.
5. Use packed bubbles to show number of reviews of different restaurants in Portland area.
6. Use word cloud to show the most frequently used words in user reviews
7. Create github page using React.js and embed tableau data charts into website for interactive data analysis.
